Why is the import package name django_chili and not just chili?
---------------------------------------------------------------

There's already a project named `chili <https://pypi.org/project/chili/>`_
that uses ``chili`` as its import package name and I wanted to avoid any
conflicts. I'm aware of the ``pip install django-PACKAGE`` / ``import PACKAGE``
convention and I am a scallywag for not following along.
